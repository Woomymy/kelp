## Versioning

Its **highly recommended** to use a versioning tool like `git` in order to version your dotfiles. For [git](https://git-scm.org) you just need to type `git init` in your "Dotfiles" directory.

## Initialisating

After installing, you just need `kelpdot init` in your Dotfiles directory. The autoconfiguration will be applied. And it's OK! You can use `kelpdot save` to backup your dotfiles and all is done!
